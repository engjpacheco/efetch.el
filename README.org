** Overview
efetch is an Emacs extension designed to display custom information in a left buffer. This tool provides a quick overview of essential details about your =Emacs= environment, including Emacs version, host information, user details, installed packages, active theme, and default font.

** Usage
To use =efetch=, simply invoke the command interactively. You can do this by executing the following command in Emacs:

#+begin_example
M-x efetch
#+end_example

** Information Displayed
The displayed information includes:

Header :: A bold and highlighted title for the efetch display.
Emacs Version :: The version of Emacs currently running.
Host :: Information about the host machine, obtained using the uname -o command.
User :: The username of the person currently logged in.
Packages Installed :: The number of packages activated in your Emacs setup.
Active Theme :: The name of the currently active Emacs theme, or "None" if no theme is active.
Default Font :: The default font family used in your Emacs setup.

** Customization
Feel free to customize the appearance or the information displayed in the efetch buffer by modifying the relevant sections in the efetch function.

** Keyboard Shortcut
A keyboard shortcut is set to close the efetch buffer and its window:

Press =q= to quickly close the *efetch-popup* buffer and its window.
*** Note
Adjust the (sit-for 7) line as needed. This line determines the =duration= the /efetch/ buffer remains visible before automatically closing. Modify the number to your preference.

** Installation
To use =efetch=, you can add the following line to your =Emacs= configuration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'efetch)
#+END_SRC
Ensure the =efetch.el= file is in a directory included in your load-path.
